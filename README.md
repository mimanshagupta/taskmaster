# To Do List in Swift

A To Do List application written in Swift for iOS.

It uses [Realm](https://realm.io/) as its database for persisting data.

# Building and Running the app

To get started, first clone the app, open the `$ cd` in to the folder and run `$ pod install`. Make sure you have [CocoaPods installed](https://cocoapods.org/#install) before running `$ pod install`.

Locate the folder in Finder and open the `To Do List.xcworkspace` in XCode. If `$ pod install` succeeded, and you opened the correct project, everything should work and you will be greeted with an empty screen with no tasks in the app.
